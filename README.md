# Install 
##### Install libsrt
* __Requires clang or gcc, cmake, git,gmake or make, and openssl__
* __The first time you use SRTfu libsrt will be built and installed automatically into the SRTfu site-packages directory__.
   * the libsrt in the SRTfu directory will only be used by SRTfu.
   * Eliminates versioning issues and having to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
   * __Tested and Working on OpenBSD and Debian Sid__. Should work on most UNIX / Linux.
   * __SRTfu is not made for Windows, you will have to build your own libsrt__

### Install SRTfu
```sh
python3 -mpip install srtfu --break-system-packages
```

# Usage
#### srtfu handles the ctype conversion and pointers. 

* srtfu is meant be easy to use.
* use __packetizer__ to receive SRT stream as mpegts packets.
* Use [__datagramer__](#datagramer) to receive SRT stream if you aren't parsing the raw video.
* use [__fetch__](#fetch) to retrieve files over srt. 
* All other functionality is built into the __srtfu.SRTfu__ class
---
# packetizer
If you've been wondering how to get 188 byte mpegts packets from SRT payloads, use packetizer.
packetizer is a generator that receives a live SRT stream and returns converted and reassembled mpegts packets.
```py3
from srtfu import packetizer

srt_url = 'srt://192.168.5.45:9000'

for packet in packetizer(srt_url):
 print(packet)
...
```
* it's that easy.
---

# datagramer
Use the __datagramer__ function to receive a live srt stream.

```py3
datagramer(srt_url,flags=None)

```
* datagramer takes an srt_url as an arg and returns a generator of raw datagram payloads.

* Complete working example

```py3
import sys
from srtfu import datagramer

srt_url = srt://10.0.0.1:9000

for datagram in datagramer(srt_url):
    sys.stdout.buffer.write(datagram)
```

___
# fetch

If you just want to retrieve files over SRT, use the fetch function. 

```py3
 fetch(srt_url , remote_file, local_file, flags=None)
```

* Complete working example

```py3
from srtfu import fetch

srt_url = srt://206.170.125.43:9000
remote_file = /home/a/video.ts
local_file = video.ts

fetch(srt_url , remote_file, local_file)
```
___

# smoketest
### The smoketest from the libsrt docs.

* create the file livekabuki.py
```py3
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
from  srtfu import datagramer

srt_url = sys.argv[1]
for datagram in datagramer(srt_url):
    sys.stdout.buffer.write(datagram)

```

* In a terminal window run

```js
ffmpeg -f lavfi -re -i smptebars=duration=300:size=1280x720:rate=30\
-f lavfi -re -i sine=frequency=1000:duration=60:sample_rate=44100\
-pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -b:v 1000k -g 30 -keyint_min 120\
-profile:v baseline -preset veryfast -f mpegts "udp://127.0.0.1:1234?pkt_size=1316"
```

* In another terminal run

```awk
srt-live-transmit udp://127.0.0.1:1234 srt://:4201 
```
* In yet another window run

```sed
python3 livekabuki.py srt://127.0.0.1:4201 | ffplay -
```
___

# SCTE35

### parsing SCTE-35 from an srt stream with threefive

* install [threefive](https://github.com/superkabuki/SCTE35-Kabuki)
  ```py3
  python3 -mpip install threefive --break-system-packages
  ```
* run threefive
```py3
threefive srt://1.2.3.4:4201
```

# low level
* Most of libsrt is available in SRTfu, the ctypes conversions are handled for you.
* If you've used sockets, this will all seem very similar.
* One note, the socket is an optional arg in methods, it only needs to be used when a server accepts a socket connection. 
* init SRTfu instance, just provide a srt_url
* a socket is created for you, but not connected.
* the srt_url sets host and port to bind for servers (0.0.0.0 works), and host and port to connect for clients
___
### init SRTfu instance

```py3
from srtfu import SRTfu

srt_url =srt://127.0.0.1:9000

srtf=SRTfu(srt_url)
```
* You can also pass a dict of socket flags to set when you create a new instance of SRTfu
```py3

  from srtfu import SRTfu, SRTO_TRANSTYPE,SRT_LIVE,SRTO_RCVSYN,SRTO_RCVBUF

  flags={SRTO_TRANSTYPE:SRT_LIVE,
         SRTO_RCVSYN:1,
         SRTO_RCVBUF: 3276800,}

  srt_url = srt://127.0.0.1:9000
  srtf=SRTfu(srt_url,flags=flags)
```

* srt_url can be where an instance is listening, or the address that an instance wants to connect to, everything is in the same class
* When an instance is created  socket, self.sock is created.
* __SRTfu methods will handle all the ctype conversions and pointers__

### set sock flags
* next you can set sock flags
```py3
    from srtfu import SRTO_TRANSTYPE,SRT_LIVE,SRTO_RCVSYN,SRTO_RCVBUF

    srtf.setsockflag(SRTO_TRANSTYPE,SRT_LIVE)
    srtf.setsockflag(SRTO_RCVSYN,1)
    srtf.setsockflag(SRTO_RCVBUF,3276800)

```
### congestion control

* set congestion control algorithm
 ```py3
   srtf.conlive()   # for live
# OR

  srtf.confile()    # for file

# OR to set any type of congestion control

srtf.congestion_control(the_algo)

```
### connect
* for clients call connect
```py3
srtf.connect()
```
### read
* SRTfu  also has a __read__ method
```py3
from srtfu import SRTfu

srt_url= 'srt://1.2.3.4:5678'
srtf=SRTfu(srt_url)
srtf.connect()
data = srtf.read(10000)

```
### bind and listen
*  for servers call bind and listen
```py3
  srtf.bind()
  srtf.listen()
```
* to accept a connection on a server
```py3
    fhandle = srtf.accept() 
```
### recv
* to receive from a client
* Note the socket is always the last arg
```py3
 smallbuff = srtf.mkbuff(1500)
 srtf.recv(smallbuff, fhandle)
```
### mkbuff

* If you need a buffer to receive into

```py3
  smallbuff = srtf.mkbuff(1500)
```
### mkmesg

* if you need to send data in a buffer

```py3
message = 'message can be strings, bytes, or ints'
new_message= srtf.mkmsg(message)
```
